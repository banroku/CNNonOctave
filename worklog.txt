implementing convBackward. 
next: to solve col2im problem.

implemented convBackward, poolBackward, reluBackward

180328  20:30-21:30 total 09:00
tested and completed forward propagation!
tested backward propagation. looks working...
next: softmax, then gradient checking. 

180330  05:00-06:00 total 10:00
implemented sofmax layer and calc J and delta
next: gradient check: correct calculation of dtheta at each layer

180331  05:45-06:15 total 10:30
fixing gradient
next: problem seems to be in affineBackward?

180331 14:00-
checking gradient....
- Suppose boutput{6} and output{4} are correct, 
  dtheta_math looks too large. 
  (dtheta = boutput{6}' * output{4} looks being correct. 
- Other hand, the math to derive dtheta_math also looks correct...
Next: try (thetaPlus - thetaMinus)/2*delta ...

180401 04:30 -   
- dtheta_math was conversed with decreasing delta, 
  thus no need to implement thetaMinus.
- J and JPlus is nealy equal, indicating calc process of JPlus is correct. 
- No mismatch in reshape/transpose process between affineForward and back. 
- calculation of theta * input was correct. 
- type of data were correct (all data were double). 

Next: correcting softmax

180402 04:30-06:30  total 12:30
- corrected softmax. dtheta_math came close to dtheta. 
- found cause: there was no initialization of thetaPlus before each adding of delta! corrected. 
- fixed reluBackward.m
- gradient checking completed (only boutput of convBackward was not validated)
- generalizedCNN might be completed... 
- revised learnByGeneralizedCNN and trainByGeneralizedCNN
Next: try learnByGeneralizedCNN(model has to be changed. try batchNo = 1 and 10, small epockNo.

180403 05:30-06:30  total 13:30
- learning process of CNN worked!!!!!
Next: complete predict.m and accuracy.m, and validate my CNN.
